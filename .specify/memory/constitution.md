## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code Practices
All code MUST follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
Rationale: Ensures maintainability and readability in a playground context.

### II. Documentation Discipline
When reading or using Nuxt or any other library, contributors MUST refer to the latest official documentation or the documentation matching the version specified in `package.json`.
Rationale: Prevents errors due to outdated or mismatched documentation.

## Additional Constraints

There are NO strict rules about unit test coverage for this playground project.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for this project. Amendments require documentation and a version bump according to semantic versioning:
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes or principle removals/redefinitions.
- MINOR: New principle/section added or expanded.
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes.
Compliance review is expected for all major changes.

**Version**: 2.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original date unknown | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-30
